This is a project from the time I was making my bashelor degree at Bia≈Çystok University of Technology Computer Science course.
It was September of 2017. Lots of things have changed since then.

The architecture of this project is based on the MVP. It was before I even heard of things like MVVM, LiveData, ViewModel etc.
The conncept behind this was to separete the view implementation from the activity making it a separate class insted of an interface implemented by activity.
I was using [some youtube videos](https://youtu.be/--wragcEDtI "some youtube videos") as a reference, since it looked interesting.

This project is **only for code reviewing**. It wont run since I've removed `google-services.json` for obvious reasons. 

### Design & Architecture

This was my bachelor degree project. **For in depth architecture, functionalities and design review go to my** [Google Drive Folder](http://https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LimhOzOZ5qVrSvGPq4rX-jysgHrprqRz?usp=sharing "Google Drive Folder") which contains the thesis, presentation, and a short film that shows the functionalities in action! You will find a good explanation there.
It is ** only in polish**, unfortunetely. 
If you wish to have it explained in english -- contact my via email: michaldanilowski@gmail.com
